# Payment Gateway Settings - Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Payment Gateway Settings feature provides restaurant administrators with a secure, intuitive interface to configure and manage payment processing systems. This feature enables independent payment gateway configuration without requiring developer intervention, supporting both Stripe and PayPal with comprehensive security controls and real-time validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Payment Gateway Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a restaurant administrator, I want to configure payment gateways through a secure admin interface, so that I can enable payment processing without technical assistance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin accesses the Payment Settings page THEN the system SHALL display configuration options for Stripe and PayPal gateways
2. WHEN an admin toggles a payment gateway THEN the system SHALL enable/disable that gateway for customer transactions
3. WHEN an admin selects an environment (Test/Live) THEN the system SHALL switch the gateway to the appropriate mode
4. WHEN an admin enters gateway credentials THEN the system SHALL validate the format and store them securely
5. WHEN an admin saves configuration THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive data before database storage
6. WHEN an admin views saved credentials THEN the system SHALL display masked values with option to reveal

### Requirement 2: Secure Credential Management

**User Story:** As a restaurant administrator, I want my payment credentials stored securely, so that sensitive financial data is protected from unauthorized access.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN payment credentials are saved THEN the system SHALL encrypt them using AES-256 encryption
2. WHEN credentials are displayed THEN the system SHALL show masked values (e.g., "pk_test_****1234")
3. WHEN an admin clicks "Show" on a credential field THEN the system SHALL require additional authentication
4. WHEN credentials are transmitted THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS with certificate pinning
5. WHEN accessing payment settings THEN the system SHALL require admin role and active session
6. WHEN credentials are modified THEN the system SHALL log the change with timestamp and user ID

### Requirement 3: Real-time Gateway Validation

**User Story:** As a restaurant administrator, I want to test payment gateway connections before going live, so that I can ensure payments will work correctly for customers.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin clicks "Test Connection" THEN the system SHALL perform a live API validation call
2. WHEN a connection test succeeds THEN the system SHALL display a green "Connected" status indicator
3. WHEN a connection test fails THEN the system SHALL display error details and troubleshooting guidance
4. WHEN gateway credentials are invalid THEN the system SHALL prevent saving and show specific error messages
5. WHEN webhook URLs are configured THEN the system SHALL validate endpoint accessibility
6. WHEN environment is switched THEN the system SHALL automatically retest the connection

### Requirement 4: Multi-Gateway Support

**User Story:** As a restaurant administrator, I want to configure multiple payment gateways simultaneously, so that I can offer customers various payment options and have backup processing capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple gateways are enabled THEN the system SHALL allow customers to choose their preferred payment method
2. WHEN a primary gateway fails THEN the system SHALL automatically fallback to secondary gateway
3. WHEN gateway priorities are set THEN the system SHALL process payments in the specified order
4. WHEN gateway fees differ THEN the system SHALL display cost comparison information
5. WHEN transaction limits vary THEN the system SHALL route payments to appropriate gateways
6. WHEN both gateways are disabled THEN the system SHALL prevent checkout completion

### Requirement 5: Environment Management

**User Story:** As a restaurant administrator, I want separate test and production payment configurations, so that I can safely test payment processing without affecting live transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in Test mode THEN the system SHALL use sandbox/test API endpoints
2. WHEN in Live mode THEN the system SHALL use production API endpoints
3. WHEN switching environments THEN the system SHALL load appropriate credentials automatically
4. WHEN test transactions are processed THEN the system SHALL clearly mark them as test data
5. WHEN going live THEN the system SHALL require explicit confirmation and validation
6. WHEN environment status is unclear THEN the system SHALL display prominent warnings

### Requirement 6: Audit Trail and Compliance

**User Story:** As a restaurant administrator, I want complete audit logs of payment configuration changes, so that I can maintain compliance and track system modifications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN payment settings are modified THEN the system SHALL log the change with full details
2. WHEN credentials are accessed THEN the system SHALL record the access event
3. WHEN configuration is exported THEN the system SHALL log the export with user and timestamp
4. WHEN audit logs are viewed THEN the system SHALL display chronological change history
5. WHEN compliance reports are needed THEN the system SHALL generate detailed activity summaries
6. WHEN suspicious activity occurs THEN the system SHALL alert administrators immediately

### Requirement 7: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a restaurant administrator, I want an intuitive payment settings interface, so that I can configure gateways efficiently without technical expertise.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing payment settings THEN the system SHALL display a clean, organized configuration interface
2. WHEN configuring gateways THEN the system SHALL provide helpful tooltips and guidance
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear, actionable error messages
4. WHEN settings are saved THEN the system SHALL provide immediate confirmation feedback
5. WHEN configuration is complex THEN the system SHALL offer step-by-step setup wizards
6. WHEN mobile access is needed THEN the system SHALL provide responsive design support

### Requirement 8: Integration with Existing Systems

**User Story:** As a restaurant administrator, I want payment settings to integrate seamlessly with existing order processing, so that configuration changes take effect immediately without system disruption.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN payment settings are updated THEN the system SHALL apply changes to active checkout processes
2. WHEN gateways are disabled THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle in-progress transactions
3. WHEN new gateways are enabled THEN the system SHALL make them available for immediate use
4. WHEN webhook configurations change THEN the system SHALL update endpoint registrations automatically
5. WHEN settings conflict with orders THEN the system SHALL provide clear resolution options
6. WHEN system maintenance occurs THEN the system SHALL preserve payment configurations safely
